<h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
</div>
<div class="pg">
<p>My name is John Smith (Student ID S#######), I can be reached at S#######@student.rmit.edu.au. I am a 36 year old male from Adelaide, South Australia and I have decided that I would like to further develop my skills and hopefully gain employment within the IT industry. I have a wonderful family with a wife and we have 2 boys both under the age of four that keep us a bit busy and it has made me realise that I should chase my dream of working in the field of IT. I have come from a warehousing and logistics background (with around 20 years’ experience) and have even had a career in Music (guitar) tuition. When my boys aren’t keeping me busy I also enjoy playing cricket for my local club in the summer.</p>

<h2>INTEREST IN IT</h2>
</div>
<div class="pg">
<p>I think I was quite lucky to have just started schooling when computers and the wonderful world of IT started entering the syllabus. It was still early days but I think I have always had a good grip on computers having grown up around them. I think it was really high school where I really started excelling with IT and after I graduated, I went and enrolled into a Network Engineering course at Adelaide TAFE. I found this course to be highly interesting and motivating. Along with family, personal events, and working life that occurred while I was at TAFE, I had to withdraw about halfway through my studies and enter the job market. I always had the goal of going back and finishing my diploma but unfortunately I continually put my career on hold for other reasons. Recently I was working in a job I didn’t really like which I held for 13 years and I had the realisation that I will most likely be working for the better part of 30 years. I thought to myself, wouldn’t I’d rather spend that time doing something that I actually enjoy. This has led me to chase a career in Information Technology.</p>
<p>So with this realisation I started to research what kind of degree will get me where I want to go and what institution will get me there. That’s where I decided to join RMIT in a bachelor of IT. I had heard great things about RMIT and it appealed to me a lot. RMIT also has a great benefit of being a strong leader in online learning which in particular suits me well as I am still working full time while supporting my family.</p>
<p>I am hoping to complete my bachelor of Information Technology with RMIT and then I want to find work within the industry while studying a further associate degree in Cyber Security. I am hoping to learn really a bit of everything related to Information Technology from programming, security, web design to even just the level of professionalism required in the industry. I believe this course will provide me with a solid basis and deeper understanding of Information Technology.</p>

<p>What I really want to do is to get into a career as a Network Engineer / Cyber Security. I studied it when I was younger and found great interest in it, I would like to continue on that path. A job I was able to find online is the following advertisement I found on <a href="www.seek.com.au">www.seek.com.au</a> (Boeing Cyber Security Network Specialist). This kind of job role will take me a long time to achieve but I believe I have the determination and motivation to succeed.</p>
<p>This job interests me as I have already studied Network Administration at a TAFE level and found the course to be fascinating. Even after I left the course I was always trying to find out more information about the subject of Networks and to be honest, since I stopped studying Network Engineering the technology has changed quite a bit.</P>
<p>I understand that there are a lot of skills required for this particular position. Some of these skills include qualifications that have to be obtained through training providers. For example, a CISSP (stands for <b>C</b>ertified <b>I</b>nformation <b>S</b>ystems <b>S</b>ecurity <b>P</b>rofessional) and has to be certified by a doing a course supplied by a training provider. Also, they are after someone who is familiar with the Australian Cyber Security Centre Information Security Manual which can be found on the government cyber security website <a href="www.cyber.gov.au">www.cyber.gov.au</a>. This is something I will have to go over and learn in detail. They are looking for someone with knowledge in the following fields Network connectivity and configuration, Windows and Linux Client-server systems, hardware and software systems support and maintenance and Engineering Change Management processes.</p>
<p>I do not have any real qualifications beside a Certificate III in Network Administration but I believe this course (Bachelor of Information Technology) can give me a greater core-understanding of what I need to do to achieve my goals. I have also looked at Cyber security degrees that are offered as associate degrees for when I have finished the undergraduate degree. I will also look to do some Cisco courses (such as a CCNA (<b>C</b>isco <b>C</b>ertified <b>N</b>etwork <b>A</b>ssociate)) to try to bolster my resume so that when I go for a job like this, they will feel like there are no worries in me doing the tasks required and will hopefully have all the information to do the job competently.

<h2>Myers-Briggs Test</h2>

<div class="pg">
  <div class="clr">
<p>For the Myers-Briggs test <a href="https://www.16personalities.com">(16 personalities)</a> I had the result of Turbulent Defender. My five dominant traits were: Introverted, Observant, Feeling, Judging and Turbulent. My role was sentinel and my strategy was constant improvement. As a Sentinel they describe me as cooperative, practical and grounded and that I seek security, stability and order. I believe this is partially true as I am a father and I am always trying to look for a stable lifestyle for my family and to have a secure lifestyle. I believe this will work well in a group because I believe I am always trying to be cooperative and seeking order to how things are done. Some of the strengths of a Defender are supportive, reliable & patient, observant and enthusiastic and loyal and hard working. Some of the weaknesses are humble/shy, repression of feelings, heavy workloads and are too altruistic.</p>

<p>For the learning styles test I received a result of visual learner <a href="https://www.how-to-study.com/study-skills-articles/visual-learner.asp">Learning Styles Test</a>. A visual learner can be described as someone who learns more from information that can be presented in written form or another format such as diagrams or pictures. I believe this could be true as I have found a lot of benefit in reading about whatever I am learning rather than hearing someone giving a lecture about it. In a team I might need to make sure I keep a diary and take plenty of notes to make sure I haven’t missed anything. I think a good suggestion on things that may help visual learners is to replace words with symbols when taking notes, this is because I always try to write as much information down and if I can use something such as shorthand, I should be able to do it a bit quicker at getting the information down without missing and key details.</p>

<p>I decided to take an Enneagram test for my third online test <a href="https://www.truity.com/test/enneagram-personality-test">Enneagram Test</a>. An Enneagram test describes how our emotions can drive our lives and how we react with others so that we can get what we want or need. I got a very strong result of a “one” which makes a bit of sense because level ones thrive on order and that show great commitment and determination in areas that need improvement. A trait that could work well in a group for “Ones” are that they tend to encourage others to perform at their best. Ones can be described as dutiful, responsible, and perfection seeking. I find this to be all too true with me as I have once worked for a company where I was in charge of Health and Safety which would have the traits of dutiful and responsible while I always see myself as a bit of a perfectionist.</p>

<h2>PROJECT IDEA</h2>
</div>
<div class="box2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
</div>
<div class="pg">
<p>For my IT Project idea, I have decided to write about an idea I had a few years ago when I was a music teacher. This idea goes on the lines of automated online tuition for guitar where the each part has to be completed to go onto the next lesson. I was thinking that at the end of each lesson the student would actually have to play the music back of what they learnt in the lesson to progress to the next one. If they fail to playback the music correctly it would mean they would have to practice until they get it right.</p>
</div>
<div class="box2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
</div>
<div class="pg">
<p>When I was a teacher I found that I could always tell which students had learnt from outside sources such as youtube as there would always be errors in their technique and they would not really be playing the instrument correctly. Most times they would lose interest and give up on the instrument rather than persevere and master what they want to get out of it. Ultimately we would definitely want students not to feel disheartened and want them to really enjoy playing. Learning music online can have its advantages such as students for the most time have to learn by ear (Marianne Stenger, 2013) and can pick tonal qualities up easier than students who have learnt from instruction.</p>
</div>
<div class="box2">
<h2>Description</h2>
</div>
<div class="pg">
<p>What I want to design is an online guitar tuition application that will be used to teach students how to play and can be viewed on mobile devices, desktops, and tablets. In recent times with a lot of schools facing budget cuts, their music programmes are normally the first thing to be cut (Marianne Stenger, 2013). Therefore I believe there is a market for online guitar tuition. This could also include connecting students with teachers so they could get feedback with what they are doing. This is a reason to why I believe students that only rely on youtube to learn, do not really learn how to play their instrument properly and have various flaws in their techniques.</p>
<p>Lessons would have to start with a prompt to tune the instrument so it would be good to have a tuner as an in-built feature. We need to tune the instrument so that the examples can be played along with, without sounding out of tune. The lessons would ideally be no longer then what could be covered in 30 minutes. I would like the layout of the page in the app to have written instructions and examples to play along with. I also think it would be beneficial to also include verbal instructional videos to back up what is written because all students pick up information in different ways as is their learning style (teach.com, 2020). A lot of lessons will also be repeating what the student learnt in the previous lessons as repetition reinforces principles (Sara Mullett, 2018).</p>
<p>One possible issue that I think may arise from this project is the use of copyrighted material. The rights of the owners of the copyrighted material include both performing the track in public and also communicating the material to members of the public (Music Rights Australia n.d.). A lot of classical music that was released earlier than the 20th century is considered “free Domain” which means the material is not copyrighted and can be freely shared. Often if the music is made before 1923, it is most likely not covered by copyright (Tim Berens, n.d.). Therefore I can take from this is that most musical exercises need to be based off music that is over 100 years old (i.e. ‘Ode to Joy’ by Beethoven) or written as an original.</p>
<p>The lessons can have various elements to it for example I would start with technique and a few songs to play to get the student hooked and motivated and then go on to things like theory and music fundamentals such as simple rhythms, learning notes, and where to find them, chords and intervals, modes, arpeggios and scales. In all there are a lot of options to fit into a musical class and it is important to have variety and flexibility in planning lessons if a child only learns theory before even playing their instrument they are likely to get bored and will give up.</p>
</div>
<div class="box2">
<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
</div>
<div class="pg">
<p>So we know what we want to develop; now how do we go and make it happen? I believe an app such as MIT App Inventor can help in creating the core of the app. MIT App Inventor was invented at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and was spearheaded by Professor Hal Abelson (MIT App Inventor n.d.). I was also thinking the website could be HTML/CSS with video streamed into it. The video might need to be converted to Flash Video File (*.flv) and embedded into the code. Obviously there will need to be hardware such as musical instruments, an audio interface such as a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 to get the music signal into the computer, and a program such as a DAW (<b>D</b>igital <b>A</b>udio <b>W</b>orkstation, i.e. Logic Pro X, Audacity, Cubase, Reaper) and record the musical content.</p>
</div>
<div class="box2">
<h2>Skills Required</h2>
</div>
<div class="pg">
<p>For this project, we will need various types of skills. The obvious one would be to know Music theory and be able to demonstrate on a musical instrument. There will be presentation skills, knowing how to hold an audience and relate information to students so they can learn. On the computing side there is app writing skills that could include programming (CSS and HTML5), also languages such as C+ and Java could help write the application (Kevin Toth, 2017). Also I believe I will have to learn video editing skills such as using video editing software (such as) So that I can record the sessions.</p>
</div>
<div class="box2">
<h2>Outcome</h2>
</div>
<div class="pg">
<p>The outcome of the project is to get potential students to learn and enjoy playing an instrument. I believe there is a market for people who want to learn how to play guitar and to play it well. There has been a spike in people trying to learn a new instrument since the global pandemic of Covid 19 (TMZ, 2020). I would like to get students to have great joy in knowing how to play with correct technique. Also, I would like to be able to develop the skills to put a product on the market like this.</p>
